        # !!! IMPORTANT !!! FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY !!!

        ### Are you up-to-date?

        Upgrade to the latest version: `$ pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir`

        Confirm latest version by running: `import yfinance as yf ; print(yf.__version__)` and comparing against [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/#history).

        ### Does Yahoo actually have the data?

        Are you spelling symbol *exactly* same as Yahoo?

        Then visit `finance.yahoo.com` and confirm they have the data you want. Maybe your symbol was delisted.

        ### Data is wrong

        **yfinance is not affiliated with Yahoo**. If Yahoo Finance website data is bad, tell Yahoo: https://help.yahoo.com/kb/finance-for-web/report-problems-feedback-ideas-yahoo-finance-sln28397.html.

        But if yfinance is creating error during processing, then finish this form.

        For price errors, try price repair: https://ranaroussi.github.io/yfinance/advanced/price_repair.html

        ### Are you spamming Yahoo?

        Yahoo Finance free service has rate-limiting https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance/discussions/1513. Once limit hit, Yahoo can delay, block, or return bad data -> not a `yfinance` bug.
        
        ### Does issue already exist?

        Use the search tool. Don't duplicate existing issues.
